iOS lifecycle for APP:
{Theory}
Not Running: the app is considered to be in a Not Running state when it is not yet launched or terminated by the system or user.

Inactive and Active are both in foreground state.


Inactive: the app is in an inactive state when it is in the foreground but receiving events. In other words, 
we can say that it acts like a bridge state in which the app remains briefly when it transitions to a different state.

Active: it is a normal mode for the app when it is in the foreground state and receiving all the user events.

Background: the app transitions into the background state when the user taps on the home screen while using the 
application, or it requires some extra execution time. When the app is about to be suspended, then also transitions into this state for a 
small amount of time. In this state, the app remains in the background and executes the code.

Suspended: in this state, the app remains in the background and doesn't execute the code. The app is automatically moved to this state. 
In this state, the app remains in memory. However, the foreground apps are always given priority over suspended apps and can 
be purged any time without notice.

{Practical}


application: didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:-> Bool: 
when the application is launched initially, this method is called. We can do any 
initial setup for the application in this method like firebase configuration, user navigation, etc. The storyboard is loaded at this 
point, but we can maintain the state restoration.
(In this the app goes from Not running to foreground[Inactive])

applicationWillEnterForeground: 
this method is called after [didFinishLaunchingWithOptions]. It is also called when the application comes 
from background to foreground.
(The app comes  from the background state and into the froeground[Incative] and ties to go to the active state)


applicationDidBecomeActive: 
this method is called after [applicationWillEnterForeground]. If we need to perform any particular task when the app 
comes into the foreground, like font update, etc., then we can place the code in this method.
(This method is called when the application becomes active from inactive. You can use it to restart tasks or update the user interface.)



applicationWillResignActive: this method is notified when the application is about to become inactive. For example, the user receives a phone call;
the user presses the home button, etc.).
(Is called when the app goes from active to inactive state)


applicationDidEnterBackground: this method is notified when the application goes into a background state after become inactive.



applicationWillTerminate: this method is called when the application is about to be finally terminated from memory. If we need to perform 
any final cleanups, then we can place the code in this method.
